Escrow payment service with saga pattern orchestration and compensating transactions.

## Features

- Escrow payment initiation and processing
- Saga orchestration for distributed transactions
- Compensating transactions for failure scenarios
- Platform fee calculation and distribution
- Mock Stripe integration via ACL
- Automatic refund processing
- Payment status tracking and auditing

## Payment Lifecycle

States: `pending` → `held` → `released` / `refunded`

- **pending**: Payment initiated, awaiting confirmation
- **held**: Funds held in escrow
- **released**: Funds distributed to runner and platform
- **refunded**: Funds returned to owner

## Kafka Integration

**Events Published:**
- payment.escrow_held
- payment.escrow_released
- payment.escrow_refunded
- payment.escrow_failed

**Events Consumed:**
- booking.delivery_confirmed (triggers release)
- booking.cancelled (triggers refund)

## Database Schema

- **payments**: Payment records with escrow state
- **transactions**: Ledger for all payment operations
- **platform_fees**: Platform fee calculations and tracking

## Saga Pattern

The service implements compensating transactions for failure scenarios:
- If escrow hold fails, booking is automatically cancelled
- If release fails, payment remains in held state for manual intervention
- Failed refunds are logged for manual processing
